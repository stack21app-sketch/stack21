Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Tu nombre], founder of Stack21.

TL;DR: We're Zapier but with AI and 50% cheaper.

THE STORY:

6 months ago I was paying $80/mes for Zapier.

Spent 3 hours setting up each workflow.

Thought: "This is stupid. AI could do this."

So I built Stack21.

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:

🧠 AI that creates workflows from text
"Send important emails to Slack" → Done in 5 min

💰 50% cheaper than Zapier
$29/mes vs $80/mes = $612/year savings

⚡ 5-minute setup
Not 3 hours. Not kidding.

🔧 Code steps included
Write JavaScript/Python if you need

WHY LAUNCH ON PH:

You're our people. Early adopters. Builders.

Want honest feedback from folks who get it.

SPECIAL FOR PH:

🎁 Lifetime 50% OFF for first 100 signups
🎁 Free onboarding (I do it personally)
🎁 Feature requests prioritized

Just use code: PRODUCTHUNT50

QUESTIONS I'LL ANSWER TODAY:

Ask me anything about:
• How we built it
• Tech stack
• Competition
• Pricing
• Roadmap
• Whatever!

I'll be here all day responding.

Thanks for the support! Let's make automation accessible. 🚀

[Tu nombre]

P.S. Our first user saved $2K/year switching from Zapier. That's why we build.
