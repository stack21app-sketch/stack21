Subject: Quick question about automation at [Company]

Hi [First Name],

Saw you're [Role] at [Company] - congrats on [recent news/funding/launch]!

Quick question: How are you handling automation currently? Zapier? Make? Something else?

Reason I ask: We built Stack21 specifically for companies like [Company] that:
‚Ä¢ Want automation but hate slow setup
‚Ä¢ Need AI features (not just connections)
‚Ä¢ Want to save 50%+ vs Zapier

Worth 15-min chat?

Best,
[Tu nombre]
Founder, Stack21

P.S. Built Stack21 because I hated paying $80/mes for Zapier. Now 600 companies use us instead.

```
Subject: Should I stop emailing?

[First Name],

I've sent you a few emails about Stack21.

Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing:

A) Super busy (I get it)
B) Not interested (totally fine)
C) Emails going to spam (damn)

If A: Reply "LATER" and I'll follow up in 3 months.
If B: Reply "NOT INTERESTED" and I'll never bother you again.
If C: Reply anything and I'll add you to whitelist.

Either way, no hard feelings.

Appreciate your time!

)
return vips
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **AI Suggestions**
