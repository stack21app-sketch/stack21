Subject: Quick question about automation at [Company]

Hi [First Name],

Saw you're [Role] at [Company] - congrats on [recent news/funding/launch]!

Quick question: How are you handling automation currently? Zapier? Make? Something else?

Reason I ask: We built Stack21 specifically for companies like [Company] that:
• Want automation but hate slow setup
• Need AI features (not just connections)
• Want to save 50%+ vs Zapier

Worth 15-min chat?

Best,
[Tu nombre]
Founder, Stack21

P.S. Built Stack21 because I hated paying $80/mes for Zapier. Now 600 companies use us instead.

### **Email 4: Break-up Email (Día 10)**

```
Subject: Should I stop emailing?

[First Name],

I've sent you a few emails about Stack21.

Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing:

A) Super busy (I get it)
B) Not interested (totally fine)
C) Emails going to spam (damn)

If A: Reply "LATER" and I'll follow up in 3 months.
If B: Reply "NOT INTERESTED" and I'll never bother you again.
If C: Reply anything and I'll add you to whitelist.

Either way, no hard feelings.

Appreciate your time!

### **Email 3: Best Practices (Día 5)**

```
Subject: 3 errores comunes (evítalos)

[Name],

Llevas 5 días en Stack21.

Quiero mostrarte los 3 errores que veo en nuevos usuarios:

❌ ERROR 1: Intentar automatizar TODO a la vez
✅ MEJOR: Empieza con 1-2 workflows, master them, luego agrega más

❌ ERROR 2: No testear antes de activar
✅ MEJOR: Usa "Test Mode" antes de production

❌ ERROR 3: Olvidar monitorear
✅ MEJOR: Check el dashboard 2x/semana mínimo

Bonus tip:
🎯 Workflows más útiles son los que haces 10+ veces/día

¿Cuál es ese para ti?

### **Email 4: Pro Tips (Día 8)**

```
Subject: Secreto para workflows 10x mejores 🤫

Hey [Name],

Pro tip que pocos saben:

Puedes hacer workflows MUCHO más potentes con:

1️⃣ **Code Steps**
Stack21 deja ejecutar JavaScript/Python.
Significa: Lógica compleja sin limitaciones.

Ejemplo:
```javascript
// Filtra emails VIP con regex custom
const vips = emails.filter(e => 
  /ceo|founder|director/i.test(e.from)
)
return vips
```

2️⃣ **AI Suggestions**
Cada workflow → Click "Optimize"
IA sugiere mejoras automáticamente.

3️⃣ **Conditional Branching**
If/else pero visual.
IA puede configurarlo por ti.

Tutorial video: [link] (3 min)

Vale la pena. Prometo.

Growth ($29/mes) te da:

• Priority support

Plus: Early adopter 50% OFF → $14.50/mes

That's 50 cents/día.

## 💰 SECUENCIA 4: Upsell Free → Paid (4 emails)

### **Email 1: Hitting Limits (Cuando usa 80% del free tier)**

```
Subject: Heads up: 80% usage 📊

Hey [Name],

Quick FYI:

Has usado 80 de tus 100 executions gratuitas este mes.

### **Email 3: ROI Calculator (Día 2)**

```
Subject: Your ROI with Stack21 Growth

Hey [Name],

Let's do math 🧮

CURRENT (Free):
• 100 executions/mes
• Limited features
• Cost: $0

GROWTH ($14.50/mes with 50% OFF):
• 1,000 executions/mes
• All features
• Cost: $174/año

YOUR ROI:

Time saved: 15 hrs/mes (conservative)
Your rate: $50/hr (conservative)
Value: $750/mes = $9,000/año

Investment: $174/año
Return: $9,000/año

ROI: 5,000%

Math doesn't lie.

### **Email 4: Last Chance (Día 3)**

```
Subject: Last chance: 50% OFF expires tonight

[Name],

This is it.

50% OFF expires tonight at midnight.

After that:
• Growth goes from $14.50 → $29/mes
• You lose early adopter status
• Miss out on $174/year savings

I'd hate for you to miss this.
